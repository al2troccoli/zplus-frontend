# zooplus-frontend: Animals registry code challenge

## Instructions
To start the development node server execute the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Puerto del servidor de desarrollo
The application is configured to start on port 3000 by default.

### Axios `base_url`
The development base_url configured for axios is 'http://localhost:3001/'.

This url has to be the same as the backend node server provided in this code test.

If you want to change the `base_url` of axios, modify line `83` of the `nuxt.config.js` file.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
